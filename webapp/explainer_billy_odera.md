## 📊 Problem

Over 15 million Kenyans are employed by MSMEs, yet most operate in a **data vacuum**. They have the data — buried in M-Pesa SMS messages and CSV exports — but lack the tools to analyze it. Meanwhile, access to credit remains a major hurdle because traditional banks reject loan applications without "formal" financial statements.

**LipaInsight bridges this gap** by giving every Mama Mboga and Instagram Boutique owner the analytics tools that were previously reserved for enterprises — and generates professional credit reports they can take to a Sacco or bank to prove their business health.
